# The process of initiating speech and the search for good analysis tools

Talk at McEwan University on 10 March 2025.

**Abstract:** My talk concentrates on two themes. First, how speech production is
initiated in delayed naming experiments, and second, how to let the research
questions guide the choice of tools. We will explore these themes by walking
through some of my PhD thesis data and the choices I made in its analysis. The
data is single word utterances in a delayed naming experiment where the
participants have been asked to wait for the go signal at rest. This gives us a
window to how the movement onset relates to the acoustic onset and the
utterance duration as a whole. The data was recorded with tongue ultrasound
imaging. I used movement onset detection methods which spared me from having to
find the onset in grainy grayscale videos. All of this will provide motivation
for keeping an open mind when it comes time to select research tools, and if
necessary, find new ones.
